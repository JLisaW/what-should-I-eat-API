Process

I started creating this app by creating user stories to help me determine the user experience I wanted.  I built the back-end using Rails which helped me determine the relationships.  I started by building the backend to help me determine the API single resource relationships.  I tested the CURL scripts to make sure my functions were running properly on Rails.  Then I started creating the front-end functionality using Javascript, Bootstrap, HTML, Handlebars, and jQuery.  I created a basic HTML/CSS for a visual of what I wanted the app to entail and test the functionalities I was going to create.  Finally I styled the application with CSS.

Unsolved Problems/Major Hurdles

The purpose of this application is help users decide what he/she should eat to improve his/her mood.  The user would be able to create custom moods and foods they associate with the particular mood.  One unsolved problem I had is that I did not set my table to include a food ID which is why I could not "add food item" functionality.
